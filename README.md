# Tink Merchant Task

This is a web app that integrates with Tink API to fetch users' account and transaction data and analyzes it so your can know what you favorite merchant is, plus other curiosities.

This app was forked from [Tink Connect Example](https://github.com/tink-ab/tink-connect-example).

This app was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Other than that, it has been made as simple as possible.

## Installation

The application requires a Tink API developer account.

### Prerequisites

1. Create your developer account at [Tink Console](https://console.tink.com)
2. Follow the [getting started guide](https://docs.tink.com/resources/getting-started/set-up-your-account) to retrieve your `client_id` and `client_secret`
3. Register the redirect URI for the example app (`http://localhost:3000/callback`) in the [list of redirect URIs under your app's settings](https://console.tink.com/overview)

### Structure

- **Node server/backend**: can be found in `server.js`
- **React client/frontend**: can be found in the `client` folder.

## Running the app locally

1. Install the dependencies.

```
$ npm install
```

2. Set your client identifier and client secret into the following environment variables

```
$ export REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID="<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>"
$ export TINK_CLIENT_SECRET="<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>"
```

3. Run both the backend (`server.js`) and the frontend (`client` folder) concurrently:

```
$ npm run dev
```

You should be redirected to the client app on `http://localhost:3000/`. The client runs on port `3000` and the server runs on `8080`.
